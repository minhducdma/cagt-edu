## Commit Guidelines

We use CommitLint to enforce commit message conventions. Please follow the guidelines below when writing commit messages:

- Use the present tense ("add feature" instead of "added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("fix bug" instead of "fixed bug")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Separate the subject from the body with a blank line
- Capitalize the subject line
- Do not end the subject line with a period
- Use the body to explain what and why vs. how

Here are the types of commit messages that we use:

- feat: A new feature
- fix: A bug fix
- docs: Documentation changes
- style: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
- refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- test: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- chore: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation generation

Here is an example of a good commit message:

```
feat: add new feature to login page

This commit adds a new feature to the login page that allows users to reset their password.

Closes #123
